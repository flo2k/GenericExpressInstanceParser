GenericExpressInstanceParser
============================

GenericExpressInstanceParser (geip) is an open source generic C++ parser for EXPRESS Instances, written with flex and bison. 

It offers a
- library for parsing EXPRESS Instances from files and from the memory (for public use version 1.0),
- and a executable (geip) to transform EXPRESS Instances to Xml and vice versa (for public use version 0.2).

EXPRESS is a data modelling language that is defined in the ISO 10303-11, and it is part of the STEP (Standard for the Exchange of Product model), ISO 10303. EXPRESS has a definition language for a schema, to define own data structures, and EXPRESS Instances are their data, with respect of the defined schema. The focus of the GenericExpressInstanceParser are the EXPRESS Instances. It works on EXPRESS Instances without the knowledge of the schema.
